**Heart Shape with Turtle Graphics**

This Python program uses Turtle Graphics to create a visual representation of a heart shape using parametric equations. The heart shape is generated by plotting points based on mathematical functions, creating a unique and vibrant design against a black background.

**Program Details**

The heart shape is drawn by defining two mathematical functions, hearta(k) and heartb(k), which use trigonometric functions to define the x and y coordinates for each point on the heart shape. The Turtle module is then used to plot each point, resulting in a dynamic and colorful heart graphic.

**Functions Used**
- hearta(k): Defines the x-coordinate of the heart shape using the sine function.
- heartb(k): Defines the y-coordinate of the heart shape using cosine functions.
  
**Parameters**
- The Turtle's speed is set to 1000 to increase drawing speed.
- The background color is set to black (bgcolor("black")).
- The loop iterates 6000 times to ensure the heart shape is fully drawn.
-Coordinates are scaled by 20 to increase the heart's size.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- turtle module (comes pre-installed with Python)
**How to Run**
1. Clone this repository or download the code.
2. Run the script in an environment that supports graphical display (e.g., IDLE, PyCharm, or any Python editor with graphical support).
3. Watch as the Turtle draws a beautiful heart shape!

This program uses mathematics and Turtle graphics to create a visually engaging heart shape.
